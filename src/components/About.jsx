        This project is made by Shuabe, Absara and James, and is made with the
        intention of completing the project requirements in the CCL course,
        which entails us to do the following: Make a react project using vite,
        use a css library to style your app, use axios to make an HTTP request
        to an API, and use react router to route to 2 or more pages.
      </span>
